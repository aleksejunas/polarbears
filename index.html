      <h2 class="svaldbard_heading">Polarbears in Svalbard</h2>
      <pre class="pre">
        In Svalbard, most bears are found in areas with sea ice.
        The western part of Spitsbergen therefore has low densities
        of bears most of the year, while higher densities are found
        along the east coast, and also in the fjords to the north.
        Many bears hunt at glacier fronts in the fjords in the spring
        because ringed seal lairs are concentrated in such areas.
        The most important denning areas for polar bears in Svalbard are
        located on Kongsøya, Svenskøya, Edgeøya, Nordaustlandet and Hopen.
        In Svalbard, some bears have small home ranges of a few hundred
        square kilometres where they hunt on the sea ice in the spring;
        during summer these bears wait on land for the sea ice to freeze again.
        Other bears follow the retreat of the sea ice and move north-east or east
        in the summer, hunting at the ice edge or in Franz Josef Land in Russia.
        The Barents Sea population of polar bears includes animals that den in
        both Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. Movement westwards to Greenland,
        or from Greenland to Svalbard, seem to be quite restricted.

      <h2 class="facts_heading">Quick facts about polarbears</h2>

<pre class="pre">
       Scientific name: Ursus maritimus

       Inuktitut name: Nanuq

       Average weight: 400 - 600 kg (males) 150 - 250 kg (females)

       Average lifespan: approximately 25 years

       Super Swimmers
       Polar bears have been known to swim up to 10 kilometres per
       hour and farther than 90 kilometres without a rest.
       They can hold their breath underwater for more than a minute.

       Canadian Icon
       More than two-thirds of the world’s polar bears are found in
       the Canadian Arctic.

       Uncertain Future
       Because they rely on sea ice to hunt ringed seals, polar bears
       are especially vulnerable to climate change.

       Did you know?
       Polar bear fur has no colour. It’s transparent and only looks
       white because it reflects light. Here’s another surprise:
       polar bears have black skin under their fur, which helps
       capture heat from the sun.</pre>
